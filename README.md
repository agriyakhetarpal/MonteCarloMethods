# MonteCarloMethods

A simple code that aims to solve the mathematical conundrum derived from the popular idiom "The straw that broke the camel's back". This code has been provided in the form of a MATLAB script which runs using three user-defined functions and uses the Monte Carlo methods to compute the answer to the riddle, which comes out to be 2 - e/2

The loop runs from 1 to 30, which means that the approximation(s) is/are done upto a massive value of 2^30 = 1,07,37,41,824 times to improve the accuracy of the method.
